# fonetones.github.io
Github fonetones website.
The idea is simply, many musicians can build the website together to sell their music. First, buy fonetones (FON) ERC20 brand tokens
if you want. Then, improve the website and watch the FON brand tokens appreciate in value. Another idea is, but i am not sure currently, like https://www.fonetones.co.za was registered, other fonetones websites can be registered, to benefit from the use of the word fonetones and listing of the website, on this Github site, adding value to the FON brand tokens.
